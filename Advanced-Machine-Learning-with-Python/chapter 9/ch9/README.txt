Chapter 9 is largely informational, providing background on useful technical tools and describing their use. 

For this reason, I recommend the enclosed 3rd-party github tutorial repositories as a means of getting started. 

PLEASE EXPRESS RESPECTFUL SUPPORT OF THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THESE TUTORIAL CODE SOLUTIONS!

Lasagne:

Tensorflow:
https://github.com/pkmital/tensorflow_tutorials

For your convenience I have cloned these repositories into local subdirectories. 

However I encourage that you check for updates and as above, pass on any positive feedback to the hard-working authors of the tutorial code.
