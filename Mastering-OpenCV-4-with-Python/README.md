**A practical guide covering topics from image processing, augmented reality to deep learning with OpenCV 4 and Python 3.7**

## What is this book about?
OpenCV is considered to be one of the best Open Source Computer Vision and machine learning software libraries. It helps developers build complete projects on image processing, motion detection, and image segmentation. OpenCV for Python enables you to run computer vision algorithms smoothly in real time, combining the best of the OpenCV C++ API and the Python language.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Handle files and images, and explore various image processing techniques 
* Explore image transformations like translation, resizing, and cropping 
* Gain insights into building histograms 
* Brush up on contour detection, filtering, and drawing 
* Work with augmented reality and 3D visualization frameworks 
* Work with machine learning, deep learning, and neural network algorithms

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
channels = cv2.split(img)
eq_channels = []
for ch in channels:
    eq_channels.append(cv2.equalizeHist(ch))
```
